@article{Gubbi2013,
abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Ye2012,
abstract = {Pervasive systems must offer an open, extensible, and evolving portfolio of services which integrate sensor data from a diverse range of sources. The core challenge is to provide appropriate and consistent adaptive behaviours for these services in the face of huge volumes of sensor data exhibiting varying degrees of precision, accuracy and dynamism. Situation identification is an enabling technology that resolves noisy sensor data and abstracts it into higher-level concepts that are interesting to applications. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the nature and characteristics of situations, discuss the complexities of situation identification, and review the techniques that are most popularly used in modelling and inferring situations from sensor data. We compare and contrast these techniques, and conclude by identifying some of the open research opportunities in the area. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lin2012,
abstract = {With the development of service-oriented computing environments, QoS-aware service selection has been a more and more important research issue. In service composition environments, QoS attributes of atomic services are always aggregated for computing the QoS of the composite services, which has been reported in many previous studies. However, there are situations that some QoS attributes cannot be aggregated for composite services. For example, it is difficult to compute the translation quality of a composite translation service by simply aggregating its component atomic services (machine translation service, morphological analysis service, dictionary service). Moreover, when multiple QoS attributes are used for evaluating services, it is always difficult to maximize all the QoS attributes because there might be anti-correlated relations between them. To address above problems, this paper proposes an approach for selecting services based on context-aware factors of QoS attributes. In our proposed approach, context-aware factors that affect QoS attributes are first extracted from analyzing their correlation with QoS attributes. Then, QoS data is generated based on the extracted factors for QoS prediction and evaluation. Further, dynamic service selection is realized based on QoS prediction and evaluation considering user requirements. We use a case study in the domain of language service with some experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach.},

@article{Zeng2004,
abstract = {The paradigmatic shift from a Web of manual interactions to a Web of programmatic interactions driven by Web services is creating unprecedented opportunities for the formation of online business-to-business (B2B) collaborations. In particular, the creation of value-added services by composition of existing ones is gaining a significant momentum. Since many available Web services provide overlapping or identical functionality, albeit with different quality of service (QoS), a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. This paper presents a middleware platform which addresses the issue of selecting Web services for the purpose of their composition in a way that maximizes user satisfaction expressed as utility functions over QoS attributes, while satisfying the constraints set by the user and by the structure of the composite service. Two selection approaches are described and compared: one based on local (task-level) selection of services and the other based on global allocation of tasks to services using integer programming.},

abstract = {QoS computation plays an important role in Web service selection. It involves property value preprocessing aspect, user satisfaction calculation aspect, and aggregation of multiple QoS properties aspect. However, little attention has been paid to users participating in QoS computation. In this paper, we examine QoS computation from the angle of experienced users and novice users. An experienced user is able to be more active in providing configuration information such as expected boundary of a QoS property, distribution function of user satisfaction, and the aggregation weight of each QoS property. While a novice user has limited experience to do this. Based on the study of user-centered factors in QoS computation, we propose a user-centered QoS computation, which provides a new choice of normalization in property value preprocessing aspect, an approach of approximation in user satisfaction calculation aspect, and a weight suggestion way in aggregation of multiple properties aspect. A case study in translation service selection shows that the proposed user-centered QoS calculation is more efficient for novice users than random configuration, and much more efficient for experience users.},

@article{Alrifai2009,
abstract = {The run-time binding of web services has been recently put forward in order to support rapid and dynamic web service compositions. With the growing number of alternative web services that provide the same functionality but differ in quality parameters, the service composition becomes a decision problem on which component services should be selected such that user's end-to-end QoS requirements (e.g. availability, response time) and preferences (e.g. price) are satisfied. Although very efficient, local selection strategy fails short in handling global QoS requirements. Solutions based on global optimization, on the other hand, can handle global constraints, but their poor performance renders them inappropriate for applications with dynamic and real-time requirements. In this paper we address this problem and propose a solution that combines global optimization with local selection techniques to benefit from the advantages of both worlds. The proposed solution consists of two steps: first, we use mixed integer programming (MIP) to find the optimal decomposition of global QoS constraints into local constraints. Second, we use distributed local selection to find the best web services that satisfy these local constraints. The results of experimental evaluation indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of computation time while achieving close-to-optimal results.},
